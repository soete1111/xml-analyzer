         Body="&lt;p>Arabic was never a single language, even before Islam and even when Islam came. That's why Quran was sent to Mohammed in 7 different tongues (dialects), not be confused with Qira'at (القراءات). The common dialect at that time was لغة قريش. It is called Arabic mainly because of the race, not because of the language itself. &lt;/p>&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p>Anyway, same thing is applicable now, the classical Arabic we see now is mainly from Quran and Current Quran is mainly from the Quraish version (one of the seven dialects). In addition to that, each country/region/tribe of Arabs has its own dialect/accent, nothing new here as this was the case throughout history. &lt;/p>&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p>To answer your question, this site should be about all Arabic Language variants (classic or dialects) especially that almost all Arabs are capable of understanding each other mutually with no problems.&lt;/p>&#xA;"

         Body="&lt;p>As I see it, this issue can be broken into two distinct concerns:&lt;/p>&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol>&#xA;&lt;li>Should we as a site cater to questions &lt;em>about&lt;/em> dialectual variants of Arabic?&lt;/li>&#xA;&lt;li>Should we as a site encourage posts &lt;em>written&lt;/em> in dialectual variants of Arabic?&lt;/li>&#xA;&lt;/ol>&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p>For the first case, I think questions &lt;em>about&lt;/em> different dialects should be allowed, for much the same reason Henry mentioned: &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.arabic.stackexchange.com/a/3/10&quot;>The regional dialects form a large portion of Arabic as it's spoken today&lt;/a>. Cutting dialects out of the scope would likely cut out a significant majority of our potential activity.&lt;/p>&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p>For the second case, however, I feel that there's value in establishing some clear guidelines to prevent the site from just becoming a mish-mash of dialects. I would suggest the following:&lt;/p>&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol>&#xA;&lt;li>&lt;p>Consider English and Fusha as the &quot;official&quot; languages of this site&lt;/p>&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul>&#xA;&lt;li>Assuming that the majority of our users can (a) understand Fusha, and (b) understand English, seems to be a reasonable compromise (short of just abandoning English-language entirely, which given most of the posts on the site so far (including this meta) are written in English is probably going to be a hard sell)&lt;/li>&#xA;&lt;li>Using regional dialects in meta discussions should be expressly discouraged; community opinion can only truly be gauged if the bulk of the community can reasonably &lt;em>understand&lt;/em> what is being discussed, and many Arabic dialects are not mutually understandable. &lt;/li>&#xA;&lt;li>Meta posts, policy discussions, FAQs with any sort of &quot;official&quot; weight &lt;em>must&lt;/em> be written in one or the other (ideally both).&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul>&#xA;&lt;li>Any meta posts which the Stack Exchange community team (rather than just the site community/moderators) may need to be aware of must be written in English, as few if any of them are fluent in Arabic. In particular, this would include things like bug reports and feature requests.&lt;/li>&#xA;&lt;/ul>&lt;/li>&#xA;&lt;/ul>&lt;/li>&#xA;&lt;li>&lt;p>Allow questions on the main page in regional dialects, but only if they're expressly &lt;em>about&lt;/em> some aspect of that dialect, and &lt;em>tagged appropriately&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul>&#xA;&lt;li>Users should be allowed to ask questions in the manner which is most comfortable to them when possible; using their own dialect seems safe, so long as any possible answer would be relevant to that dialect&lt;/li>&#xA;&lt;li>It is reasonable to assume that any experts capable of answering a question &lt;em>about&lt;/em> a particular dialect is also &lt;em>fluent&lt;/em> in that particular dialect. Conversely, it is reasonable to assume that any experts &lt;em>not&lt;/em> fluent in that particular dialect are poorly qualified to answer questions &lt;em>about&lt;/em> that particular dialect.&lt;/li>&#xA;&lt;li>This allows users fluent/not-fluent in particular dialects to selectively ignore/highlight/select questions that they can actually understand based on tags.&lt;/li>&#xA;&lt;/ul>&lt;/li>&#xA;&lt;li>Insist that answers on the main page only use dialect if the question is written in that dialect.&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul>&#xA;&lt;li>English questions should get English answers, and Arabic questions should get Arabic answers.&lt;/li>&#xA;&lt;li>Even if a question is tagged with a dialect, if it's asked in (a) Fusha, or (b) English, so must the answer be written&lt;/li>&#xA;&lt;/ul>&lt;/li>&#xA;&lt;/ol>&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p>In short, the only time a dialect should be used is if it&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol>&#xA;&lt;li>&amp;hellip;is a question about and tagged with that particular dialect, or&lt;/li>&#xA;&lt;li>&amp;hellip;is an answer posted to a question using that dialect.&lt;/li>&#xA;&lt;/ol>&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p>Otherwise, either Fusha or English should be used.  From my understanding (I am hardly an Arabic native) Fusha is rather universally &lt;em>understood&lt;/em> among Arabic speakers, even when it's rarely if ever actually &lt;em>spoken&lt;/em>.

These moderation tasks have to be done by the community.&lt;/p>&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p>A basic moderation task is to make sure that new questions are tagged appropriately.

As such, users have no guidance as to whether a tag is appropriate for their question.

Each tag should have a tag-wiki which justifies its existence and distinguishes its use from existing tags.

SO can use &quot;Large blocks of code with requests for debugging without meaningful supporting info&quot; as a specific OT reason.&lt;/p>&#xA;&lt;/blockquote>&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p>So what does this mean for Arabic? Well, with enough consensus, the community could add a custom off-topic close reason for cases like these.

On a language site like Arabic, many questions would qualify as what used to be &quot;too localized&quot; on Stack Overflow. They answer one person's question, but they don't always solve a common problem people have when writing or speaking Arabic that they'll end up searching for.&lt;/p>&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p>And yet, &lt;strong>we still find such questions (examples: &lt;a href=&quot;http://arabic.stackexchange.com/q/43/45&quot;>1&lt;/a>, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arabic.stackexchange.com/q/47/45&quot;>2&lt;/a>) valuable&lt;/strong>&lt;sup>1&lt;/sup> as we build a compendium of knowledge about Arabic--and a community of knowledgeable people who like learning and teaching about Arabic concepts and history.&lt;/p>&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p>So, tl;dr: &lt;/p>&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol>&#xA;&lt;li>&quot;Too Localized&quot; was removed as a close reason deliberately.&lt;/li>&#xA;&lt;li>If this community finds questions like those to be counterproductive or bad for the site, they can still be closed with custom reasons.&lt;/li>&#xA;&lt;li>But I'm not as sure as you are that they should be closed.&lt;/li>&#xA;&lt;/ol>&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr>&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p>1: I can't read Arabic so I've done my best to choose questions that I think illustrate my point, but please let me know if I'm off base here.&lt;/p>&#xA;"

         Body="&lt;p>I have a question about an Arabic word – specifically, how to appropriately morph the word to make it diminutive – because I wish to use the word and its morphed (diminutive) form in an English writing project. I do not know any Arabic, and while I have attempted to research this topic, my knowledge of Arabic is too limited to feel confident that I have correctly understood what I have found.&lt;/p>&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p>It may be that it is not appropriate to ask such a question here; I know during the 51 phase there was a question regarding questions in English and a desire at least among some users to keep them limited to truly sincere students of the language – and sadly, I do not have the time to be that. The answers to this question suggested to me that this site is really primarily for people who already speak Arabic, not for teaching English speakers (that is, that the site is the Arabic analogue of the English Language &amp;amp; Usage site, &lt;em>not&lt;/em> the English Language Learners site).&lt;/p>&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p>On the other hand, the existing &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.arabic.stackexchange.com/q/8/275&quot;>meta question&lt;/a> on the subject does suggest that it is open to all levels, the analogue of ELL as well as EL&amp;amp;U. I assume that this more-recent discussion is more reflective of the community that is actually here, but I wish to be sure. Moreover, it may be that my question is too basic to even qualify me as a “beginning student,” as indeed, I am not studying the language as a whole.&lt;/p>&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p>I wish to respect this community, and if my question is not appropriate, I will not ask it. It is important for new Stack Exchange sites to set boundaries on what is on-topic, and to try to avoid setting precedents that will cause trouble in the future. I will simply move forward with what I have found and hope it’s close enough so that Arabic speakers who read my work can appreciate what I was going for (since the work is in English, context will be sufficient to understand the distinction for those who understand no Arabic; I merely would like for Arabic speakers to see it as “right.”)&lt;/p>&#xA;"

I don't really care about my question, but for the good of this site I believe this kind of question must be encouraged. Here is some details &lt;/p>&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul>&#xA;&lt;li>&lt;p>Is it fruitful to search on Google?&lt;/p>&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p>The fact that Internet is full of material is a reason way this reference-request question has to be allowed because in general what you get by Google results are poor pedagogic things written by unknown authors with no guarantee of the quality of the exposition and of the material. and the lake of a substantial data base on the Internet of Arabic books makes your request unreachable (sits like goodreads has limited Arabic books titles). I got just a single answer but I don't think I could find the references proposed by searching on Google.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&#xA;&lt;li>&lt;p>Applied Vs theory .&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&#xA;&lt;/ul>&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p>In some way I understand why stackoverflow has baned this kind of question, and In some sense why things is different here, because stackoverflow  is based on an applied science, but SE sites like &lt;a href=&quot;http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/reference-request&quot;>Theoretical Computer Science&lt;/a> or &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/reference-request&quot;>Mathematics&lt;/a> as they are based on theoretical science, have always welcomed this questions. Moreover, I still think that the formulation of questions in the link given by BigOTHER are totally different from my asked question ( I didn't ask neither about the best nor about the worst ).&lt;/p>&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul>&#xA;&lt;li>&lt;p>Is it an opinion based question ?&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&#xA;&lt;/ul>&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p>What is an opinion based question? is an experience based question an opinion based question? ; In the general meaning of opinion : yes, it is. but I don't think this is the type of the question this attribution is made for. Experience is a justified opinion (in general by objective factors, but the choice of those factors and their importance is an opinion ) and it's no longer a simple opinion, and the central idea of SE is to exchange experience and knowledge. And I think question like &lt;code>what is the best reference on ...&lt;/code> has to be changed to &lt;code>what you have read on ...&lt;/code> or &lt;code>based on what you have read, what do you recommend on ...&lt;/code> and easily an opinion-based become an experience-based and I believe this is fine for our community. &lt;/p>&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p>Now, if that kind of question turn to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/big-list&quot;>Big-list&lt;/a> question (I never seen that in Math SE). in its own I don't think it's a problem, but If moderators feel that lazy answers is given I think this kind of question has to be changed to Community Wiki. They can also organize answers in one answer containing what it was proposed so long.&lt;/p>&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul>&#xA;&lt;li>Restriction Vs any other solution.&lt;/li>&#xA;&lt;/ul>&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p>The best place to learn  is the place without lot of restrictions.&#xA;I think in community like ours, restrictions have to be taken as the last possible correction measure. If some kind of questions makes problem of organization, adding new tags will help, and people not interested in some type questions (for example with not single exact answer) don't have to spend time by acceding in these questions, and vice versa. and I believe this flexibility will guarantee the growth of this site.&lt;/p>&#xA;"

         Body="&lt;p>We're still in the process of assembling the &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.arabic.stackexchange.com/q/50/45&quot;>pro tem moderator team&lt;/a> for this site. It's been a little hard to get a team together, mainly due to lack of response and activity surrounding the meta thread - and the site itself. &lt;/p>&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p>So as far as the moderator thread goes: Even if you don't want to nominate yourself or anyone else, please vote on answers there so we have a little more information to go on about the community's approval of each candidate. While this isn't an &lt;em>election&lt;/em> - the Community Team selects pro tem moderators for beta sites - it's best to be able to make these selections with more input from members of the community.&lt;/p>&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p>But outside of the question of pro tem moderators, general activity on Arabic SE is worryingly low. The site has &lt;a href=&quot;http://arabic.stackexchange.com/questions&quot;>103 questions&lt;/a> at time of this writing. I have to be honest: we've shut down sites after just 14 days of private beta that had more questions than Arabic does after &lt;strong>48 days&lt;/strong>. Arabic was allowed to survive past private beta because it's a language site. We've got &lt;a href=&quot;http://area51.stackexchange.com/categories/3/culture?tab=beta&quot;>tons of those on the network&lt;/a>, and they're frequently a little lower in activity than other sites - but we know that the model is straightforward to set up, and useful even at low volume. But this is the lowest volume we've seen yet... and that's got me worried. &lt;/p>&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p>I'd like to direct you to this recent post about &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/257614/165581&quot;>when we graduate sites, and when we shut them down&lt;/a>. Specifically:&lt;/p>&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote>&#xA;  &lt;p>What does this mean? &lt;strong>If there's enough moderation for a public beta site to consistently remain free of spam, for flags to be cleared, and for our Be Nice policy to be upheld, your site will remain open.&lt;/strong> However, if community leaders drop off, flags sit without being addressed, and we can’t find any suitable volunteers to step forward, the site gets closed.&lt;/p>&#xA;&lt;/blockquote>&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p>I'm not seeing the leadership coalescing in this community that a Stack Exchange site really needs to thrive - or even just survive. I don't just mean moderators; I'm talking about the core community of active users who lead the site through their activity on the main Q&amp;amp;A site and their participation on meta.  &lt;/p>&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p>Sites don't often come back from problems like this one. Momentum is extremely hard to build once it's lost, and Arabic SE didn't have much momentum to begin with. I hope this community can rally, but that will mean a lot more activity from everyone involved - in addition to more users joining the conversation about pro-tem mods.&lt;/p>&#xA;"

         Body="&lt;p>Last week, I wrote a bit of &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.arabic.stackexchange.com/q/76/45&quot;>an S.O.S. call for Arabic SE&lt;/a>. The call was for us to figure out a way to bail out this site, which is sinking slowly due to inactivity. I cited specifically the difficulty we're finding in putting together a moderator staff and the extremely low question volume Arabic has had since launch. &lt;/p>&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p>A few brave souls responded to the call. There was a blip on the radar for the pro-tem moderator hunt, and a small group of people bumped our question count by 12 this past week. (We now have 115 questions at time of writing - but that number is still lower than the threshold below which most sites won't make it out of private beta.) &lt;/p>&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p>If the site had been getting 12 questions per week consistently since the private beta, I would consider that a low but respectable amount of activity - but I must assume even this level of activity wouldn't continue if the site were to remain open. This is a handful of people trying to bail out the site, when what we need is a crew working together to build momentum. Without that cohesive community, we have to abandon ship. &lt;strong>We'll be shutting down this site on Monday, September 14.&lt;/strong> There will be an archive of all posts available &lt;a href=&quot;http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/62022/arabic-language&quot;>on Area 51&lt;/a> shortly after closure.&lt;/p>&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p>I'd really like to see this topic rebooted in a new Area 51 proposal. This one got a lot of support in Area 51 and launched relatively quickly, but somehow the promising community evaporated when private beta rolled around: only 1.8% of committers fulfilled their commitment. If you can build a community that will pull together for the next private beta, the Arabic Language topic could enjoy the same success here as many of the other language sites we host.&lt;/p>&#xA;"
